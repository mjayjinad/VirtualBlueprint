# VirtualBlueprint

VirtualBlueprint is a real-time immersive collaboration tool designed for architectural visualization. It enables developers wearing VR headsets to stream live video and audio walkthroughs of virtual spaces to remote stakeholders on Android or desktop devices. The platform also supports spatial sticky notes within VR to capture feedback and ensure accurate client-developer communication.

# Key Features
1. Real-time VR Streaming: Stream live 3D walkthroughs directly from the developerâ€™s headset.

2. Cross-Device Viewing: Stakeholders can view streams on mobile phones or desktops.

3. Spatial Sticky Notes: Place digital notes in the virtual environment to document feedback during live sessions.

4. Low Latency & Optimized Streaming: Uses WebRTC for efficient, low-latency video and audio transmission.

5. Robust Connection Handling: Detects peer disconnections and manages streaming lifecycle gracefully.

6. Microphone Mute Controls: Mute/unmute local microphone without affecting incoming audio.
